# Overview

I am trying to get a feel for Java with this program. I wanted to see how to use loops, if statements, how to save unput from the user, and I wanted to see how Java does random numbers. I noticed that Java uses classes, I am a little curious to see similarities between it and C#.

I made a simple game of rock, paper, scissors that the user will play against the computer.

# Development Environment

For my code editor I used VS Code, I only used two libraries: Random and Scanner. These libraries let me create random numbers and save the user's input.

# Future Work

Some things that I might work on in the future:

- I want to see how having multiple code files works. For example, when I worked with C# I could have a parent and child class, if I wanted to make different ways to play rock paper scissors, but use the program I have now as the base for the game, could I make a class that uses the current code in diferent ways depending on the selected game mode?
- I might add more games than just rock paper scissors, I could add hangman and see how lists work, I could add a trivia game, or I could add chess.
- I do want to figure out how to get the display to put a â•‘ symbol after the user's input. I think I saw something about using a grid, but I'll have to look into it.
